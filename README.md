Here we have 3  fully connected, feed-forward neural network models that were trained on a 1000-sample to classify numbers from mnist public dataset.
Properties of three models : 

First model : 
1 hidden layer with 15 neurons. 

Second model : 
2 hidden layers with 15 neurons.

Third model : 
2 hidden layers with 30 neurons.

Best accuracy : 88.7%
